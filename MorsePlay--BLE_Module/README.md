# MorsePlay BLE module

To install the firmware for the BLE module, you will need a [RedBearLab Nano V2](https://www.seeedstudio.com/RedBear-BLE-Nano-Kit-V2--p-2836.html).

You will need to ensure [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) is installed.

Next, configure the device following Sandeep Mistry's [Arduino NRF5 Core](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/arduino-nRF5) to make it programmable by Arduino.

This will allow you to add the RedBear Nano V2 to your board list.

Mistry's Arduino [BLE Peripheral library](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/arduino-BLEPeripheral) is then used.
